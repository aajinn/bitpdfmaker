# What is BitPDFMaker?

BitPDFMaker is a smart tool designed to help students, professionals, and researchers efficiently extract and embed notes into their PDF documents. Our aim is to enhance productivity by compressing large content into quick-glance boxes directly inside PDFs.

## Our Mission

We believe in simplifying information consumption. Whether it's for last-minute revision or building your cheat sheets (ethically for studies), our goal is to make the process fast, efficient, and private.

## Why We Built This
